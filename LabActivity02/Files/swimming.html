    <hr>
    <ul>
     <li>Swimming is the act of moving through water using coordinated body movements.</li>
     <li>I like swimming because itâ€™s refreshing, a great full-body workout, and helps me feel relaxed and energized.</li>
     <li>I learned on how to swim because I go to swimming lessons since when I was in first grade.</li>
